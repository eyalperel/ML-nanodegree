# ML nanodegree projects
Projects created as part of my udacity nanodegree in machine learning.  
*Titanic Survival Exploration* is about the titanic pasanger survival analysis and exploration.  
*Boston Housing* is about applying regression techniques to predict house prices in Boston.  
*Student Intervention* is about applying classification techniques to for student intervention decision.  
*Customer Segments* is about applying unsuperivsed learning techniques to find different customer segments.  
*smartcab* is about applying reinforcement learning to train a cab to drive accoring to the traffic rules without hitting other vehicles.  
This project can be found in the samrtcab folder in which my code is in the file agent.py and the setting of the simulation is to be  
found in the other files for completeness purposes.  
*Forex Market Predictor* is my capstone project.  
It deals with the classification problem of market direction (up or down),for different prediction intervals for the EURGBP currency pair  
using multiple techinques and comparing them to a benchmark accuracy result with in turn is based on random walk.  
In the folder my final report and the notebook in which I developed my code are to be found.  
  
It is important to note that the data is not public so in case there is an interest running the project please send me an email, and I  
will be happy to provide a zip file with the data and code.
