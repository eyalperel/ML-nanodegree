My projects created as part of my udacity nanodegree in machine learning.
Project 0 is about the titanic survival analysis.
Project 1 is about applying regression techniques to predict house prices in Boston.
Project 2 is about applying classification techniques to for student intervention decision.
Project 3 is about applyting unsuperivsed learning techniques to find different customer segments.
Project 4 is about applyinh reinforcement learning to train a cab to drive accoring to the traffic rules without hitting other vehicles.
The capstone project is a classification problem of market direction (up or down) for different prediction intervals for the Forex market
